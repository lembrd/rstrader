## XTrader Architecture & Code Quality Review

Scope: market data collector (current phase). Goal: identify fundamental design risks, bugs, and scalability issues before adding more exchanges/streams, multiple sinks, and order routing.

### Executive summary

- Overall: solid foundation (traits, modularity, metrics) but several critical correctness and resilience gaps for production-grade low-latency pipelines.
- Highest risks: order book synchronization correctness, lack of reconnection/recovery strategy, abstraction leaks (downcasts), and blocking file IO in async hot path.

### Critical issues (must fix)

1) Incorrect snapshot/stream synchronization order (Binance, OKX)

- Current flow gets REST snapshot before subscribing, which can miss deltas between snapshot and subscription. Correct algorithm is: subscribe (buffer), fetch snapshot, apply buffered updates, then process live stream.

```1:126:src/pipeline/unified_handler.rs
// L2 flow gets snapshot first, then subscribes later in run_l2_stream()
if matches!(self.subscription.stream_type, StreamType::L2) {
    let snapshot = self.connector.get_snapshot(&self.subscription.instrument).await?;
    if let crate::cli::Exchange::BinanceFutures = self.subscription.exchange {
        if let Some(binance_connector) = self.connector.as_any_mut().downcast_mut::<crate::exchanges::binance::BinanceFuturesConnector>() {
            binance_connector.initialize_synchronization(&snapshot)?;
        }
    }
}
```

Impact: gaps in deltas; potential order book inconsistency and wrong persisted history.

Action:
- Change protocol per exchange: subscribe first (enter BufferingUpdates), then fetch snapshot, apply buffered updates, then switch to Synced.
- Make this a connector-level method to avoid coordination from handler.

2) Buffered deltas are never applied (Binance)

- Connector buffers updates pre-snapshot, but `initialize_synchronization` discards them instead of emitting or replaying through the processor.

```246:275:src/exchanges/binance.rs
pub fn initialize_synchronization(&mut self, snapshot: &OrderBookSnapshot) -> Result<()> {
    if matches!(self.sync_state, SyncState::BufferingUpdates) {
        match self.process_buffered_updates(snapshot.last_update_id) {
            Ok(valid_updates) => {
                // valid_updates computed but not forwarded/emitted
            }
            Err(_) => {
                self.update_buffer.clear();
            }
        }
    }
    self.sync_state = SyncState::Synchronizing { last_update_id: snapshot.last_update_id };
    Ok(())
}
```

Impact: missing updates between connect and snapshot; inconsistency vs exchange sequence guarantees.

Action:
- On successful reconciliation, transform buffered updates and emit them to the processor before switching to live. Alternatively, feed them back through `next_message()` or provide a `drain_buffered_as_raw()` iterator.

3) Abstraction leak via downcasting to a specific connector

- `UnifiedExchangeHandler` downcasts to `BinanceFuturesConnector` to invoke sync logic.

```99:121:src/pipeline/unified_handler.rs
if let crate::cli::Exchange::BinanceFutures = self.subscription.exchange {
    if let Some(binance_connector) = self.connector.as_any_mut().downcast_mut::<crate::exchanges::binance::BinanceFuturesConnector>() {
        binance_connector.initialize_synchronization(&snapshot)?;
    } else {
        log::error!("Failed to downcast to BinanceFuturesConnector");
    }
}
```

Impact: breaks open-closed principle and makes handler exchange-aware; complicates adding more exchanges.

Action:
- Add a first-class method to `ExchangeConnector`, e.g. `prepare_l2_sync(snapshot: &OrderBookSnapshot)`, or a dedicated `OrderBookSynchronizer` trait that connectors implement when needed. Remove `as_any_mut` from the abstraction boundary.

4) Missing sequence/continuity validation (OKX, Binance) in processing path

- Processors parse messages and emit updates but do not robustly validate continuity (`prev_seq_id/seq_id`, `U/pu/u`) nor resynchronize on gaps. OKX checksum not validated; Binance `validate_update_sequence` is only consulted inside connector’s internal state, not enforced end-to-end before emitting updates to sinks.

```1096:1127:src/exchanges/okx.rs
// Parses and emits, but does not verify continuity or checksum, and does not resync on gaps
```

Impact: silently corrupts downstream order book reconstructions and analytics.

Action:
- Design a per-exchange synchronizer component encapsulating: buffering, snapshot apply, continuity checks, gap detection, and automatic resync (backoff, re-snapshot). Emit only validated updates to the processor or emit a resync event to skip.

5) No reconnection/resubscription strategy

- On any connector error, handler returns and app shuts down. No retry/backoff, re-auth, or resubscribe.

```193:199:src/pipeline/unified_handler.rs
Err(e) => {
    log::error!("Connector error: {}", e);
    return Err(AppError::stream(format!("Connector failed: {}", e)));
}
```

Impact: single transient network fault stops the entire collector.

Action:
- Add connector-level retry policy with jittered exponential backoff and max attempts, plus fast-path recoveries (e.g., WS Close → reconnect, resubscribe, re-sync order book).

6) Blocking file IO and Parquet writes in async context

- `ArrowWriter<std::fs::File>` and `std::fs::File::create` are used on the async task thread.

```113:141:src/output/multi_stream_sink.rs
let file = std::fs::File::create(&file_path)?;
let writer = ArrowWriter::try_new(file, schema, Some(props))?;
```

Impact: can block reactor threads under IO pressure; elevated tail latency; head-of-line blocking across streams.

Action:
- Offload Parquet writes to a dedicated blocking thread pool via `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` or architect a bounded write queue with one or more writer workers. Consider per-writer OS buffered writes or memory-mapped files if appropriate.

7) File rotation and lifecycle

- Writers are long-lived; no rotation based on time/size; a failure mid-file risks larger loss and prolonged footer write delays.

Action:
- Rotate by size/time (e.g., 512MB or 5min), and atomically close/commit. Expose rotation policy via CLI.

8) Bug: naive globbing in `FileManager::list_existing_files`

- Pattern contains `*` but `matches_pattern` does exact/edge-only matching; it won’t match `*_000123.parquet`.

```149:158:src/output/file_manager.rs
fn matches_pattern(&self, filename: &str, pattern: &str) -> bool {
    if pattern.starts_with('*') {
        filename.ends_with(&pattern[1..])
    } else if pattern.ends_with('*') {
        filename.starts_with(&pattern[..pattern.len()-1])
    } else {
        filename == pattern
    }
}
```

Impact: inaccurate file listing if this path is used later.

Action:
- Replace with proper globbing (e.g., `globset`) or parse suffix `_\d{6}.parquet` explicitly.

9) Double parsing and split responsibilities across connector/processor (Binance)

- Connector tries to parse depth JSON to manage sync state; processor parses again to emit updates.

Impact: extra allocations/CPU on hot path; duplicate logic; harder to reason about correctness.

Action:
- Move sync state machine into a dedicated synchronizer layer that consumes raw text once, performs continuity checks, and yields normalized deltas for the processor; or let connector surface raw messages and a separate component handle sync/parse.

10) Sink backpressure strategy and fairness

- One global channel to sink; if sink stalls, all subscriptions stall. No prioritization or fairness across high-vol streams; no bounded spill or drop strategy per stream.

Action:
- Consider per-stream bounded channels → central writer pool; add metrics for queue depth; define policies (block, drop oldest, drop trade-only during stress, etc.) depending on business priorities.

### Medium-priority improvements

- Unify stream types and extendable routing: `StreamData` is good; consider a sink trait (e.g., Kafka, UDP multicast, Parquet) behind a fan-out dispatcher to add more sinks without changing pipeline code.
- Consolidate metrics: define a metrics facade (e.g., `metrics` crate or OpenTelemetry) to export to Prometheus; include queue depths, reconnect counts, resync counts, and per-exchange latencies.
- Structured error categories: `AppError::is_recoverable()` exists; wire this into reconnection/resubscribe policies and handler lifecycle decisions.
- CLI/config: add per-exchange tuning (depth channel, update speed, checksum enable, snapshot depth) and writer policies (batch size, flush interval, rotation strategy).

### Low-priority/code quality

- `increment_batches_written()` increments `messages_processed` which conflates semantics; add a dedicated counter.
- Use `SmallVec` or pre-sized Vecs for known-small allocations in processors.
- Prefer `&'static str` or enums for stream type identifiers instead of free-form strings; you already have `StreamType` in CLI; carry it through.

### Near-term design proposal (concrete)

- Introduce `OrderBookSynchronizer` per exchange implementing:
  - subscribe → buffer
  - get snapshot
  - reconcile(buffer, snapshot)
  - validate continuity (Binance U/pu/u, OKX prevSeqId/seqId, checksum)
  - resync on gap/checksum fail
  - yield a stream of normalized, validated `StreamData::L2`

- Update `ExchangeConnector` to add optional hooks:
  - `fn supports_l2_sync() -> bool`
  - `async fn prepare_l2_sync(&mut self, snapshot: &OrderBookSnapshot) -> Result<()>`
  - Or drop these and make the synchronizer own the connector’s `next_message()` and drive the protocol.

- Add `Reconnector` wrapper with backoff and a simple state machine shared by all connectors.

- Add `Sink` trait and fan-out writer:
  - `async fn write(&self, StreamData)`
  - Provide implementations: `ParquetSink`, `KafkaSink`, etc.
  - Central dispatcher does batching and fairness across streams.

### Validation plan

- Add integration test suite per exchange to validate sequence continuity and resync behavior against recorded fixtures.
- Stress test: many streams, induce sink slowness, validate backpressure behavior and latency distributions.
- Fault injection: WS closes, timeouts, parse errors → observe automatic recovery and no process exit.

### Summary of actionable backlog

- Fix L2 sync order and buffered delta application; remove downcasts via proper trait hooks.
- Implement sequence/continuity validation and resync (incl. OKX checksum).
- Add reconnection/backoff and automatic resubscribe.
- Move Parquet IO to blocking worker(s) and add time/size-based rotation.
- Introduce sink abstraction and fan-out dispatcher for future multi-sink support.
- Correct file globbing in `FileManager::list_existing_files`.

Addressing the above will significantly improve correctness, resilience, and scalability before expanding into more exchanges/streams and adding OMS/order routing.
